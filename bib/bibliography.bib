	abstract = {We prove the \$K({\textbackslash}pi,1)\$ conjecture for affine Artin groups: the complexified complement of an affine reflection arrangement is a classifying space. This is a long-standing problem, due to Arnol'd, Pham, and Thom. Our proof is based on recent advancements in the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as on several new results and constructions. In particular: we show that all affine noncrossing partition posets are {EL}-shellable; we use these posets to construct finite classifying spaces for dual affine Artin groups; we introduce new {CW} models for the orbit configuration spaces associated with arbitrary Coxeter groups; we construct finite classifying spaces for the braided crystallographic groups introduced by {McCammond} and Sulway.},

	abstract = {This article resolves several long-standing conjectures about Artin groups of Euclidean type. Specifically we prove that every irreducible Euclidean Artin group is a torsion-free centerless group with a decidable word problem and a finite-dimensional classifying space. We do this by showing that each of these groups is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with an infinite-type Garside structure. The Garside groups involved are introduced here for the first time. They are constructed by applying semi-standard procedures to crystallographic groups that contain Euclidean Coxeter groups but which need not be generated by the reflections they contain.},

	title = {An Introduction to Garside Structures},
	abstract = {Geometric combinatorialists often study partially ordered sets in which each covering relation has been assigned some sort of label. In this article we discuss how each such labeled poset naturally has a monoid, a group, and a cell complex associated with it. Moreover, when the labeled poset satisﬁes three simple combinatorial conditions, the connections among the poset, monoid, group, and complex are particularlpaolini_salvetti_kpi1_2021y close and interesting. Posets satisfying these three conditions are (roughly) equivalent to the notion of a Garside structure for a group as developed recently within geometric group theory by Patrick Dehornoy in [15]. The goal of this article is to provide a quick introduction to the combinatorial version of this notion of a Garside structure and, more speciﬁcally, to the particular combinatorial Garside structures which arise in the study of Coxeter groups and Artin groups. These are the labeled partially ordered sets that combinatorialists know as the generalized non-crossing partition lattices.},

	abstract = {We study a new monoid structure for Artin groups associated with finite Coxeter systems. Like the classical positive braid monoid, the new monoid is a Garside monoid. We give several equivalent constructions: algebraically, the new monoid arises when studying Coxeter systems in a “dual” way, replacing the pair (W,S) by (W,T), with T the set of all reflections; geometrically, it arises when looking at the reflection arrangement from a certain basepoint. In the type A case, we recover the monoid constructed by Birman, Ko and Lee.
	Résumé
	Nous étudions une nouvelle structure de monoı̈de pour les groupes d'Artin associés aux systèmes de Coxeter finis. Ce nouveau monoı̈de est, tout comme le classique monoı̈de des tresses positives, un monoı̈de de Garside. Nous en donnons différentes constructions : algébriquement, le nouveau monoı̈de apparaı̂t quand on étudie les systèmes de Coxeter avec un point de vue “dual”, qui consiste à remplacer la paire (W,S) par (W,T), où T est l'ensemble de toutes les réflexions ; géométriquement, il apparaı̂t quand on observe l'arrangement de réflexions depuis un point-base particulier. Pour les systèmes de type A, nous retrouvons le monoı̈de construit par Birman, Ko et Lee.},
