	abstract = {We prove the \$K({\textbackslash}pi,1)\$ conjecture for affine Artin groups: the complexified complement of an affine reflection arrangement is a classifying space. This is a long-standing problem, due to Arnol'd, Pham, and Thom. Our proof is based on recent advancements in the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as on several new results and constructions. In particular: we show that all affine noncrossing partition posets are {EL}-shellable; we use these posets to construct finite classifying spaces for dual affine Artin groups; we introduce new {CW} models for the orbit configuration spaces associated with arbitrary Coxeter groups; we construct finite classifying spaces for the braided crystallographic groups introduced by {McCammond} and Sulway.},

	abstract = {This article resolves several long-standing conjectures about Artin groups of Euclidean type. Specifically we prove that every irreducible Euclidean Artin group is a torsion-free centerless group with a decidable word problem and a finite-dimensional classifying space. We do this by showing that each of these groups is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with an infinite-type Garside structure. The Garside groups involved are introduced here for the first time. They are constructed by applying semi-standard procedures to crystallographic groups that contain Euclidean Coxeter groups but which need not be generated by the reflections they contain.},

	title = {An Introduction to Garside Structures},
	abstract = {Geometric combinatorialists often study partially ordered sets in which each covering relation has been assigned some sort of label. In this article we discuss how each such labeled poset naturally has a monoid, a group, and a cell complex associated with it. Moreover, when the labeled poset satisﬁes three simple combinatorial conditions, the connections among the poset, monoid, group, and complex are particularly close and interesting. Posets satisfying these three conditions are (roughly) equivalent to the notion of a Garside structure for a group as developed recently within geometric group theory by Patrick Dehornoy in [15]. The goal of this article is to provide a quick introduction to the combinatorial version of this notion of a Garside structure and, more speciﬁcally, to the particular combinatorial Garside structures which arise in the study of Coxeter groups and Artin groups. These are the labeled partially ordered sets that combinatorialists know as the generalized non-crossing partition lattices.},
