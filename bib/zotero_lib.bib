In this article we discuss how each such labeled poset naturally has a monoid, a group, and a cell complex associated with it. Moreover, when the labeled poset satisﬁes three simple combinatorial conditions, the connections among the poset, monoid, group, and complex are particularly close and interesting. Posets satisfying these three conditions are (roughly) equivalent to the notion of a Garside structure for a group as developed recently within geometric group theory by Patrick Dehornoy in [15]. The goal of this article is to provide a quick introduction to the combinatorial version of this notion of a Garside structure and, more speciﬁcally, to the particular combinatorial Garside structures which arise in the study of Coxeter groups and Artin groups. These are the labeled partially ordered sets that combinatorialists know as the generalized non-crossing partition lattices.},

The second part (which is logically independent of, but motivated by, the first) develops from scratch the properties of Coxeter groups in general, including the Bruhat ordering and the seminal work of Kazhdan and Lusztig on representations of Hecke algebras associated with Coxeter groups is introduced. Finally a number of interesting complementary topics as well as connections with Lie theory are sketched. The book concludes with an extensive bibliography on Coxeter groups and their applications.},

Finite-type Artin groups admit two types of interval Garside structures corresponding to their standard and dual presentations. Concerning affine Artin groups, Digne established interval Garside structures for two families of these groups by using their dual presentations. Recently, {McCammond} established that none of the remaining dual presentations (except for one additional case) correspond to interval Garside structures. In this paper, shifting attention from dual presentations to other nice presentations for the affine Artin group of type \${\textbackslash}tilde\{A\}\$ discovered by Shi and Corran--Lee--Lee, I will construct interval Garside structures related to this group. This construction is the first successful attempt to establish interval Garside structures not related to the dual presentations in the case of affine Artin groups.},

The universal covers of these K({\textbackslash}pi,1)s enjoy Bestvina's weak non-positive curvature condition.

We give several equivalent constructions: algebraically, the new monoid arises when studying Coxeter systems in a “dual” way, replacing the pair (W,S) by (W,T), with T the set of all reflections; geometrically, it arises when looking at the reflection arrangement from a certain basepoint. In the type A case, we recover the monoid constructed by Birman, Ko and Lee.

Nous étudions une nouvelle structure de monoı̈de pour les groupes d'Artin associés aux systèmes de Coxeter finis. Ce nouveau monoı̈de est, tout comme le classique monoı̈de des tresses positives, un monoı̈de de Garside. Nous en donnons différentes constructions : algébriquement, le nouveau monoı̈de apparaı̂t quand on étudie les systèmes de Coxeter avec un point de vue “dual”, qui consiste à remplacer la paire (W,S) par (W,T), où T est l'ensemble de toutes les réflexions ; géométriquement, il apparaı̂t quand on observe l'arrangement de réflexions depuis un point-base particulier.
