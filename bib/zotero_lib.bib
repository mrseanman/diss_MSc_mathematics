In this article we discuss how each such labeled poset naturally has a monoid, a group, and a cell complex associated with it. Moreover, when the labeled poset satisﬁes three simple combinatorial conditions, the connections among the poset, monoid, group, and complex are particularly close and interesting. Posets satisfying these three conditions are (roughly) equivalent to the notion of a Garside structure for a group as developed recently within geometric group theory by Patrick Dehornoy in [15]. The goal of this article is to provide a quick introduction to the combinatorial version of this notion of a Garside structure and, more speciﬁcally, to the particular combinatorial Garside structures which arise in the study of Coxeter groups and Artin groups. These are the labeled partially ordered sets that combinatorialists know as the generalized non-crossing partition lattices.},

The second part (which is logically independent of, but motivated by, the first) develops from scratch the properties of Coxeter groups in general, including the Bruhat ordering and the seminal work of Kazhdan and Lusztig on representations of Hecke algebras associated with Coxeter groups is introduced. Finally a number of interesting complementary topics as well as connections with Lie theory are sketched. The book concludes with an extensive bibliography on Coxeter groups and their applications.},

Finite-type Artin groups admit two types of interval Garside structures corresponding to their standard and dual presentations. Concerning affine Artin groups, Digne established interval Garside structures for two families of these groups by using their dual presentations. Recently, {McCammond} established that none of the remaining dual presentations (except for one additional case) correspond to interval Garside structures. In this paper, shifting attention from dual presentations to other nice presentations for the affine Artin group of type \${\textbackslash}tilde\{A\}\$ discovered by Shi and Corran--Lee--Lee, I will construct interval Garside structures related to this group. This construction is the first successful attempt to establish interval Garside structures not related to the dual presentations in the case of affine Artin groups.},

In the type A case, we recover the monoid constructed by Birman, Ko and Lee.

Ce nouveau monoı̈de est, tout comme le classique monoı̈de des tresses positives, un monoı̈de de Garside.

	abstract = {Coxeter groups are of central importance in several areas of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics. This clear and rigorous exposition focuses on the combinatorial aspects of Coxeter groups, such as reduced expressions, partial order of group elements, enumeration, associated graphs and combinatorial cell complexes, and connections with combinatorial representation theory. While Coxeter groups have already been exposited from algebraic and geometric perspectives, this text is the first one to focus mainly on the combinatorial aspects of Coxeter groups. The first part of the book provides a self-contained introduction to combinatorial Coxeter group theory. The emphasis here is on the combinatorics of reduced decompositions, Bruhat order, weak order, and some aspects of root systems. The second part deals with more advanced topics, such as Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and representations, enumeration, and combinatorial descriptions of the classical finite and affine Weyl groups. A wide variety of exercises, ranging from easy to quite difficult are also included. The book will serve graduate students as well as researchers.

	abstract = {The result of this paper is the determination of the cohomology of Artin groups of type A\_n, B\_n and {\textbackslash}tilde\{A\}\_\{n\} with non-trivial local coefficients. The main result is an explicit computation of the cohomology of the Artin group of type B\_n with coefficients over the module {\textbackslash}Q[q{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}pm 1\},t{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}pm 1\}]. Here the first (n-1) standard generators of the group act by (-q)-multiplication, while the last one acts by (-t)-multiplication. The proof uses some technical results from previous papers plus computations over a suitable spectral sequence. The remaining cases follow from an application of Shapiro's lemma, by considering some well-known inclusions: we obtain the rational cohomology of the Artin group of affine type {\textbackslash}tilde\{A\}\_\{n\} as well as the cohomology of the classical braid group \{Br\}\_\{n\} with coefficients in the n-dimensional representation presented in {\textbackslash}cite\{tong\}. The topological counterpart is the explicit construction of finite {CW}-complexes endowed with a free action of the Artin groups, which are known to be K({\textbackslash}pi,1) spaces in some cases (including finite type groups). Particularly simple formulas for the Euler-characteristic of these orbit spaces are derived.},

More recently Ozornova obtained a different proof of Dobrinskaya’s theorem based on the application of discrete Morse theory to the standard {CW} model of the classifying space of an Artin monoid. In Ozornova’s work, there are hints at some deeper connections between the above-mentioned {CW} model and the Salvetti complex, a {CW} complex which arises in the combinatorial study of Artin groups. In this work we show that such connections actually exist, and as a consequence, we derive yet another proof of Dobrinskaya’s theorem.},

First, we present the basic aspects of discrete Morse theory for regular cell complexes in terms of the combinatorial structure of their face posets. We introduce the notion of a generalized shelling of a regular cell complex and describe how to construct a discrete Morse function associated with such a decomposition. An application of Forman's theory gives us generalizations of known results about the homotopy properties of shellable complexes. We also discuss an application to a set of complexes related to matroids.
Résumé
Dans cet article nous relions la nouvelle théorie de Morse discrète due à Forman (Adv. in Math. 134 (1998) 90–145) et les théories combinatories des décompositions telles que shellability dont on connait déjà beaucoup d'applications utiles. D'abord nous interprétons les aspects de base de la théorie de Morse discrète pour des complexes cellulaires réguliers par la structure combinatorie de leur le poset de facettes. Nous introduisons la notion d'un shelling généralisé d'un complexe cellulaire régulier et nous décrivons la construction d'une fonction de Morse discrète associée à une telle décomposition. Une application de la théorie de Forman donne des généralisations de résultats connus concernant les propriétés d'homotopie de complexes shellable. Nous discutons aussi une application à un ensemble de complexes relié à des matroı̈des.},
