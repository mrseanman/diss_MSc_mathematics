In \cref{sec:config_space_intro} we used the realisation of the Coxeter group $W$ as a reflection group on a space $V$. We considered the planes of the defining reflections of $W$ as affine subspaces of $V$ and used these to define $Y_W$, the configuration space. The $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture concerns with the homotopic properties of $Y_W$. To explore these, we will first construct a new space $X_W$, the \emph{Salvetti complex}, which is homotopy equivalent to $Y_W$. This was originally defined \cite{salvetti_topology_1987, salvetti_homotopy_1994} similarly using the realisation of $W$ on a space. However, the Salvetti complex turns out to have a more useful formulation based more on algebraic properties of $W$, where we only turn these algebraic structures in to spaces at the very end. These structures arise from giving a partial order to $W$, and with this in mid, we will make some definitions.
