\paragraph{Acknowledgement}
Thank you to the University of Glasgow Mathematics faculty, particularly my excellent lecturers. Thank you to my gifted classmates, whom I consider my most important teachers.

Most of all, thank you to my brilliant supervisor, Rachael Boyd. Her superb lecturing and subsequent guidance are vital parts of this work. Her gift for teaching and intuition for good explanations has been of great help to me many times. I also give thanks to Rose Morris-Wright, Parth Shimpi and Rachael for letting me sit in on several discussions highly relevant to this work. It was a privilege to be able to be a small part of these and a pleasure to hang out. These were a timely and highly valuable intro to the relevant topics.

Finally, I give thanks to the maintenance and security staff of the University. It has been a pleasure to make use of the McMillan reading room, where this was written. I am very grateful for your work ensuring its running order, cleanliness and prompt closure at 8pm each day.
