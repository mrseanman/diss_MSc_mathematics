\paragraph{Abstract}
This work reviews some important results from a paper by Paolini and Salvetti \cite{paolini_salvetti_kpi1_2021} where the authors prove the $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture for affine Coxeter groups. This conjecture concerns the homotopy of the configuration space $Y_W$ related to a Coxeter group $W$. We provide background for readers unfamiliar with posets and their applications to topology, including some new proofs. Using this background we introduce the interval complex $K_W$. We introduce the subspaces $X^\prime_W, K^\prime_W \subseteq K_W$ and introduce the Salvetti complex $X_W$ which is known to be homotopy equivalent to $Y_W$. We show, as in \cite{paolini_salvetti_kpi1_2021}, that $X_W \simeq X^\prime_W$ and that $K^\prime_W \simeq K_W$. We conclude by exploring a new construction, \emph{fibre doubling}, and how it might be utilised to could show $K^\prime_W\simeq X^\prime_W$ for some classes of $W$.
