The proof of $X^\prime_W \simeq K^\prime_W$ in \cite[Section 8]{paolini_salvetti_kpi1_2021} constructs the necessary acyclic matching without using the patchwork theorem \cref{thm:patchwork_theorem}. Here we will suggest an alternative method that could be used to show $X^\prime_W \simeq K^\prime_W$ using the patchwork theorem similarly to how it was used in the proof of \cref{thm:subcomplex_K_prime_hom_equiv_K}. There are obvious obstacles that would rule out this method as a replacement or generalisation of the work of Paolini and Salvetti, however there is the possibility that it could show $X^\prime_W \simeq K^\prime_W$ for some non--affine $W$ (in principle $K^\prime$ is not well--defined for non-affine $W$, but this will be addressed).

First we must explore why the methods used in the proof of \cref{thm:subcomplex_K_prime_hom_equiv_K} are not suitable to prove $X^\prime_W \simeq K^\prime_W$.
