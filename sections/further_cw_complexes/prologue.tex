We will now begin to bridge the gap between some of the objects we have defined. Ultimately, we wish to show a homotopy equivalence between the space $K_{W}$ and the Salvetti complex $X_W$, which is already known to be homotopy equivalent to $Y_W$. For now, we will define a subspace $K_{W}^\prime \subseteq K_{W}$, inspired by our definition of the Salvetti complex, using subsets $T\subseteq S$ such that $W_T$ is finite.
