\subsection{The $K(\pi,1)$ Conjecture}
For a group $G$, an Eilenberg-MacLane space \cite{eilenberg_relations_1945} for $G$ is a space $X$ such that $\pi_n(X)=G$ and $\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i\neq n$. We will use the terminology ``$X$ is a $K(G,n)$ space''. The $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture for Artin groups states that for all Coxeter groups $W$, the space $Y_W$ is a $K(G_W,1)$ space. Admittedly the use of $\pi$ in the name of the conjecture is confusing.
