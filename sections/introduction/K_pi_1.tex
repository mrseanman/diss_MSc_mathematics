\subsection{The $K(\pi,1)$ Conjecture}
For a group $G$, an Eilenberg-MacLane space \cite{eilenberg_relations_1945} for $G$ is a space $X$ such that $\pi_n(X)=G$ for some $n$ and $\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i\neq n$. We will use the terminology ``$X$ is a $K(G,n)$ space''. The $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture for Artin groups states that for all Coxeter groups $W$, the space $Y_W$ is a $K(G_W,1)$ space. Admittedly the use of $\pi$ in the name of the conjecture is confusing.

We have already seen in \cref{sec:config_space_intro} that indeed $\pi_1(Y_W) \cong G_W$, thus to prove the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for type $A_n$ coxeter groups we need to verify that the higher homotopy groups of $Y_W$ are trivial. This can be done by observing that $\conf_n(\C)$ is a fibre bundle over $\conf_{n-1}(\C)$ with fibres homeomorphic to $\C \setminus \Set{\text{n distinct points}}$, as spelled out in \cite{sinha_homology_2010}.
