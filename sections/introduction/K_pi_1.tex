\subsection{The $K(\pi,1)$ Conjecture}
For a group $G$, an \emph{Eilenberg-MacLane space} \cite{eilenberg_relations_1945} for $G$ is a space $X$ such that $\pi_n(X)=G$ for some $n$ and $\pi_i(X) = 0$ for all $i\neq n$. We will use the terminology ``$X$ is a $K(G,n)$ space''. We will also use the terminology ``$X$ is a \emph{classifying space} for $G$'' to mean that $X$ is a $K(G,1)$ space.
\begin{conjecture}[$K(\pi,1)$ Conjecture]
	For all Coxeter groups $W$, the space $Y_W$ is a $K(G_W,1)$ space.
\end{conjecture}

Admittedly, the use of $\pi$ in the name of the conjecture is confusing. An equivalent formulation of the conjecture is that the universal cover of $Y_W$ is contractible. This would give us that the higher homotopy groups of $Y_W$ are trivial by \cite[Porposition 4.1]{hatcher_algebraic_2001}. A--priori this is a stronger statement than the conjecture as we have given it. But since weak homotopy equivalences are homotopy equivalences for CW complexes \cite[Theorem 4.5]{hatcher_algebraic_2001}, and $Y_W$ has a CW structure (\cref{sec:salvetti_cx}), these two statements of the conjecture are equivalent.

In the previous section we focused on Coxeter groups of type $\tilde{A}_n$ and saw that for these groups $\pi_1(Y_W) \cong G_W$. We wish to focus again on the $\tilde{A}_n$ family and prove the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture in this case. To do so, we need only verify that the higher homotopy groups of $Y_W$ are trivial. This can be done by observing that $\conf_n(\C)$ is a fibre bundle over $\conf_{n-1}(\C)$ with projection $p$ forgetting a point and fibres homeomorphic to $\C \setminus \Set{\text{n distinct points}}$, as spelled out in \cite{sinha_homology_2010}.

The space $\C \setminus \Set{\text{n distinct points}}$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bigvee_n S^1$, so we can use the fibration
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		&\bigvee_{n-1} S^1 \arrow[hook]{r} &\conf_n(\C) \arrow{r}{p} &\conf_{n-1}(\C)
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
to build a tower of fibrations
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{tikzcd}
		& 							&\vdots \arrow{d} 	\\
		&\bigvee_3 S^1 	\arrow[hook]{r} 	&\conf_4(\C)  \arrow{d} \\
		&\bigvee_2 S^1 	\arrow[hook]{r} 	&\conf_3(\C)  \arrow{d} \\
		&S^1 	\arrow[hook]{r} 	&\conf_2(\C)
	\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
where there is a short exact sequence in homotopy groups starting at each $\pi_k(\bigvee_n S^1)$ going right and down to $\pi_k(\conf_n(\C))$ for any $k$. We note that $\conf_2(\C) \simeq S^1$ and so has trivial homotopy above $\pi_1$. Similarly, $\bigvee_2 S^1$ has trivial higher homotopy. So $\pi_k(\conf_3(\C)) \cong 0$ for $k>1$, and we can continue up the tower inductively to show $\pi_k(\conf_n(\C)) \cong 0$ for $k>1$ for all $n$. So indeed $\conf_{n+1}(\C) = Y_W$ is a $K(G_W,1)$ for $W=A_n$.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite{deligne_les_1972}}]
	The $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture holds for all finite Coxeter groups $W$.
	\label{thm:k_pi_1_finite}
\end{theorem}

The paper of interest to us, \cite{paolini_salvetti_kpi1_2021}, proves the $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture for affine type Coxeter groups.
