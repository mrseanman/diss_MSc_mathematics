\subsection{Coxeter Groups and Artin Groups}

Here we will introduce the definitions for the groups of interest to this paper.
\begin{definition}[Coxeter Group]
	For a finite set of generators $S$, a Coxeter group $W$ generated by $S$ is a group with presentation of the form
	\begin{equation*}
		W = \GroupPres{ S \relations (st)^{m(s,t)} = 1 \,\,\, \forall m(s,t) \neq \infty}
		\label{eq:coxeter_presentation}
	\end{equation*}
	where $m$ is a symmetric matrix indexed by $S$ where $m(s,s)=1$ for all $s \in S$ and $m(s,t)$ takes values in $\Set{2,3,\ldots} \cup \Set{\infty}$ for all $s \neq t$.
	\label{def:coxeter_group}
\end{definition}

The infinities correspond to pairs of elements that have no explicit relations. The 1s along the diagonal of $m$ ensure that all generators have order 2. The set $R \coloneq \Set{wsw^{-1} \mid w \in W, s \in S}$ is the set of \emph{reflections} in $W$. Sometimes $S$ is referred to as the set of \emph{basic reflections}.

A graph is often used to encode the data of the matrix $m$ and its corresponding Coxeter group. In this graph each element of $S$ is a node and relations between pairs in $S$ correspond to labelled edges. There are two conventions for this labelling: The \emph{classical labelling}, where edges with $m(s,t)=2$ are not drawn, edges with $m(s,t)=3$ are drawn but not labelled and all other edges are drawn with the value of $m(s,t)$ as their label. And the \emph{modern labelling}, edges with $m(s,t)=\infty$ are not drawn, edges with $m(s,t)=2$ are drawn but not labelled and all other edges are drawn and labelled. An example highlighting these differences is given in  \cref{fig:example_coxeter_dynkin_diagrams}. In the classical labelling, if the diagram has multiple connected components then $W$ is a direct product of the groups corresponding to those components. In a similar way, in the modern labelling connected components are factors in a free product. Other topological properties of these diagrams can be used, for example in \cite{huang_labeled_2023} which proves the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for certain $W$ with diagrams being trees or containing cycles.

To each Coxeter group $W$ there is an associated Artin group $G_W$ defined as follows
\begin{definition}[Artin Group]
	For a given Coxeter group $W$ generated by $S$ with associated matrix $m$, the associated Artin group is
	\begin{equation*}
		G_W \coloneq \langle \, S \mid [s,t]^{m(s,t)} = [t,s]^{m(s,t)} \,\,\forall m(s,t) \neq \infty \rangle
	\end{equation*}
	where $[s,t]^n$ is defined to be an alternating product of $s$ and $t$ starting with $s$ with total length $n$. E.g.~$[s,t]^3 = sts$.
\end{definition}

Note that the 1s along the diagonal of $m$ now carry no meaning in the presentation and that if we add the relation $s^2=1$ for all $s \in S$ we retrieve the original Coxeter group. The Coxeter-Dynkin diagram for $W$ also encodes the data of $G_W$ and the topology of the diagram holds similar meaning. Our notation for Artin groups, $G_W$ (shared in much of the literature), seems to imply the data for the Artin group is inherited from its Coxeter group. In principal their is no precedence, but practically we often start by defining a Coxeter group and we will see that  often ``\verb|property| Artin groups'' describes a family of Artin groups to which their corresponding Coxeter groups are \verb|property|.
