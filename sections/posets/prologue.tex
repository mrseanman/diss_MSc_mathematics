In \cref{sec:config_space_intro} we used the realisation of the Coxeter group $W$ as a reflection group on an affine space $V$. We considered the planes of the defining reflections of $W$ as affine subspaces of $V$ and used these to define $Y_W$, the configuration space. To progress with the $K(\pi,1 )$ conjecture we must develop some theory to explore the homotopic properties of $Y_W$. To do this, we will first construct a new space $X_W$, the \emph{Salvetti complex}, which is homotopy equivalent to $Y_W$. This was originally defined \cite{salvetti_topology_1987, salvetti_homotopy_1994} similarly using the realisation of $W$ as symmetries of a space. However, the Salvetti complex turns out to have another formulation based on purely algebraic properties of $(W,S)$ and the poset structure of $S$ with the partial order induced by $\subseteq$. We will eventually relate the Salvetti complex to another space, $K_W$ which is described by a partial order on $W$. With this in mind, we start by introducing posets.
