\section{Poset complex}
\label{sec:poset_cx}

For some edge labelled poset $P$, we can construct a cell complex $K(P)$ from $P$ such that $\pi_1(K(P))$ is $G(P)$. First we make some definitions. An \emph{abstract simplicial complex} is a family of sets that is closed under taking arbitrary subsets.

\begin{definition}
	Given a finite abstract simplicial complex $X$, the \emph{geometric realisation} of that simplicial complex is defined as follows: For each single element set in $X$ assign a point. For each two element set assign an open edge between the two vertices it contains. For each three element set assign an open triangle, the interior of the three edges of its three subsets of size two. In this way, continue constructing simplices of dimension $n$ for each $n+1$ size set in $X$.
	\label{def:geometric_simplicial_cx}
\end{definition}

The set of all chains in a poset $P$ is an abstract simplicial complex. We define $\Delta(P)$ to be the geometric simplicial complex corresponding to the set of all chains in $P$ where each $n$--simplex is an $n$--chain of $P$. Note that as in \cite[Definition 1.7]{mccammond_sulway_artin_2017}, we define an $n$--chain to have $n-1$ elements, e.g.~$(\{1\} \subseteq \{1,2\})$ is a 1--chain.

For example, in \cref{fig:example_edge_labelled_poset}, $\Delta(P)$ would be three 3--simplices all sharing an edge (a 1--simplex) corresponding to the 1--chain $(\emptyset \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\})$. Two of the 3--simplices would share a face corresponding to the 2--chain  $(\emptyset \subseteq \Set{1} \subseteq \Set{1,2,3,4})$. We also assign an orientation on edges in $\Delta(P)$ such that the edge corresponding to the 1--chain $(x \leq y)$ points from $x$ to $y$. For a two--dimensional example, consider the following poset $P$ and corresponding $\Delta(P)$. Here we forget about edge labelling in $P$ for a moment.

\label{fig:example_edge_labelled_poset_with_KP}
\end{figure}

To construct $K(P)$, first we define a labelling on 1--chains in $P$ which extends the edge labelling in $P$. Let $A^*$ denote the set of all words corresponding to the alphabet $A$.
% \what[In the last draft I got this completely wrong. The extended labelling only extends to 1--chains. Not $n$--chains. This is important for how we identify $n$--simplices in $K(P)$, which has also changed since the last draft.]

\begin{definition}
	 Given some edge--labelled poset $(P,\leq,l \colon \mathcal{E}(P) \to A)$ and some 1--chain $(x \leq y)$ in $P$, the \emph{extended label} $\mathcal{L}(\sigma) \subseteq A^*$ is the language of all words corresponding to all saturated chains that start at $x$ and end at $y$.
\end{definition}

For example, consider the chain $(\Set{2} \subseteq \Set{1,2,3,4})$ in the context of \cref{fig:example_edge_labelled_poset_with_KP} (left). There are two corresponding saturated chains, $(\Set{2} \subseteq \Set{1,2} \subseteq \Set{1,2,3,4})$ and $(\Set{2} \subseteq \Set{2,3} \subseteq \Set{1,2,3,4})$, which respectively correspond to the words $ba$ and $ab$. So $\mathcal{L}(\Set{2} \subseteq \Set{1,2,3,4}) = \Set{ba, ab}$. Here are some illustrative examples:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mathcal{L}(\{1\} \subseteq \{1,2\}) = \mathcal{L}(\{2\} \subseteq \{1,2\}) = \{b\}$.
	\item $\mathcal{L}(\{1\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}) = \mathcal{L}(\{2\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}) = \{ba, ab\}$.
	\item $\mathcal{L}(\{1\}) = \mathcal{L}(\{2\}) = \mathcal{L}(\{1,2\}) = \cdots = \emptyset$.
\end{itemize}

We use this extended labelling to form a quotient space of $\Delta(P)$. Recall the orientation of the edge $(x \leq y)$ is from $x$ to $y$. Consider two closed $n$--simplices $e^n_\alpha$ and $e^n_\beta$ in $\Delta(P)$. We form a relation $\sim$ on $n$--simplices such that $e^n_\alpha \sim e^n_\beta$ iff there exists a continuous edge--orientation and extended label preserving map $f \colon e^n_\alpha \to e^n_\beta$.


\begin{definition}[{Poset Complex \cite[Definition 1.6]{mccammond_introduction_2005}}]
	Given some finite height edge--labelled poset $P$, the poset complex $K(P)$ is the quotient space $\Delta(P)/\approx$ where $\approx$ identifies all $n$--simplices (for any $n$) using the map $f \colon e^n_\alpha \to e^n_\beta$ corresponding to $\sim$ defined above.
	\label{def:poset_complex}
\end{definition}

In the example in \cref{fig:example_edge_labelled_poset_with_KP}, three red edges are identified, four blue edges are identified, two black edges are identified, two orange triangles are identified and two purple triangles are identified. The orientation of the triangles is indicated by a $\acts$ symbol.

We see that this space is homeomorphic to a torus, which has fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}^2 \cong \left\langle a,b \mid ab = ba \right\rangle$, which is also the $G(P)$ for this edge--labelled poset. This fact holds in general, which we now begin to prove.
Let $A^*$ denote all formal words, including formal inverses, in $A$.

\begin{lemma}
	Given an edge labelled poset $(P, \, \leq, \, l \colon \mathcal{E}(P) \to A)$, the group $\pi_1(K(P))$ is generated by a set of loops in bijection with $A$.
	\label{lem:fund_group_poset_complex_gen_labels}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Each vertex $p \in \Delta(P)$ has extended label $\emptyset$ and so there is only one vertex in $K(P)$, denote this point $p_0$. The 1--skeleton of $K(P)$ will be a wedge of circles, one for each extended label in $\Set{\mathcal{L}(C) \given C \text{ is a 1--chain}}$. The following is the setup of our proof.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let $\Sigma$ denote 1--chains in $P$.
		\item Let $\Omega$ denote paths between vertices of $\Delta(P)$ along a single 1--simplex of $\Delta(P)$ such that the direction along the 1--simplex corresponding to $(x \leq y)$ is from $x$ to $y$.
		\item Let $\Lambda$ denote loops along 1--simplices in $K(P)$ that start and end at $p_0$. If $\lambda \in \Lambda$, then $[\lambda] \in \pi_1(K(P),p_0)$.  
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Let $\alpha$, be the map from 1--chains to corresponding paths in $\Delta(P)$ and $\beta \colon \Delta(P) \to K(P)$ be the quotient map as in the definition of $K(P)$. Consider the following diagram.

	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzcd}
			&\Sigma \ar[r, "\alpha"] &\Omega \ar[r, "\beta"] &\Lambda
		\end{tikzcd}
	\end{equation*}
	
	By our remarks on the 1--skeleton of $K(P)$, we see that $\pi_1(K(P), p_0)$ is generated by the homotopy classes of $\image(\beta \circ \alpha)$. Let $\sigma = (x < y) \in \Sigma$ be a 1--chain and let $\lambda$ be such that $\beta ( \alpha (\sigma)) = \lambda$. Let concatenation of loops $\lambda$ and $\lambda^\prime$ be denoted $\lambda\lambda^\prime$ such that $[\lambda][\lambda^\prime] = [\lambda\lambda^\prime]$. We similarly define concatenation of paths in $\Sigma$. We will show that $\lambda$ has a factorisation where one of the factors is $\beta(\alpha(x \lessdot z))$ for some $z \in P$.


	There exists $z \in P$ such that $x \lessdot z \leq y$. If $z \neq y$, there is a 2--simplex in $\Delta(P)$ corresponding to the 2--chain $(x \lessdot z < y)$. One of the edges of this 2--simplex corresponds to the 1--chain $(x\lessdot z)$.
	The path $\alpha(x \leq y)$ is homotopic (through the 2--simplex $(x \lessdot z < y)$) to the path $\alpha(x \lessdot z)\alpha(z < y)$. Let $H$ witness this homotopy. We have that $\beta \circ H$ is well--defined (and continuous), so the loop $\lambda$ is homotopic to the loop $\beta(\alpha(x \lessdot z)\alpha(z < y)) = \beta(\alpha(x \lessdot z))\beta(\alpha(z < y))$. We repeat the process replacing $\sigma$ with $(z<y)$. Eventually this must stop since our poset is of finite height. After this, we achieve a factorisation of $\lambda$, entirely in factors of the form $\beta(\alpha(r\lessdot s))$.
	
	Consider $\mathcal{E}(P)$ as a subset of all 1--chains in $P$. We see that $\pi_1(K(P),p_0)$ is generated by the homotopy classes of loops in $\image(\beta \circ \alpha|_{\mathcal{E}(P)})$. Each covering relation $(r\lessdot s)$ has extended label $\Set{l(r\lessdot s)}$, therefore $\theta \colon A  \to \image(\beta \circ \alpha |_{\mathcal{E}(P)})$ defined as $\theta(a) = \Set{a}$ is our required bijection.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	For an edge-labelled poset $P$, there exists a surjective homomorphism\newline$\phi \colon G(P) \to \pi_1(K(P),p_0)$ where $p_0$ is as in the previous lemma.
	\label{lem:exists_surj_hom_onto_fund_group}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let us follow from the notation in the proof of \cref{lem:fund_group_poset_complex_gen_labels} and let $\theta \colon A \to \pi_1(K(P), p_0)$ be the bijection at the end of that proof such that we have $\GroupPres{\image(\theta \circ l)} = \pi_1(K(P),p_0)$.

	Let $\sigma = (x_1 \lessdot \cdots \lessdot x_i)$ and $\sigma^\prime = (x^\prime_1 \lessdot \cdots \lessdot x^\prime_j)$ be two saturated chains such that $x_1 = x^\prime_1$ and $x_i = x^\prime_j$ with corresponding words $w = w_1\cdots w_{i-1}$, and $w^\prime = w^\prime_1\cdots w^\prime_{j-1}$ in $A^*$ such that $l(x_k \lessdot x_{k+1}) = w_k$ and similarly for $\sigma^\prime$. Recall that $w$ and $w^\prime$ are words that are identified by the relations in the defining presentation for $G(P)$. We want to show there exists a homotopy between the loop $\theta(w_1)\cdots\theta(w_i)$ and the loop $\theta(w^\prime_1)\cdots\theta(w^\prime_j)$.
	
	By doing the process in the proof of \cref{lem:fund_group_poset_complex_gen_labels} in reverse, we get a homotopy between  $\theta(w_1)\cdots\theta(w_i)$ and $\beta(\alpha(x_1 \leq x_i))$ through the two skeleton of $K(P)$. By the same argument, we get a homotopy between $\theta(w^\prime_1)\cdots\theta(w^\prime_j)$ and $\beta(\alpha(x^\prime_1 \leq x^\prime_j))$. Since $x_1 = x^\prime_1$ and $x_i = x^\prime_j$, we have $\theta(w_1)\cdots\theta(w_i) \sim \theta(w^\prime_1)\cdots\theta(w^\prime_j)$.
	
	We have shown that $\pi_1(K(P), p_0)$ has all necessary relations to extend $\theta$ to a surjective homomorphism $\phi \colon G(P) \to \pi_1(K(P), p_0)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Given an edge labelled poset $(P, \, \leq, \, l \colon \mathcal{E}(P) \to A)$, we have $\pi_1(K(P)) \cong G(P)$.
	\label{thm:fund_group_poset_complex_poset_group}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We again follow the notation from \cref{lem:fund_group_poset_complex_gen_labels}.
	In the proof of \cref{lem:fund_group_poset_complex_gen_labels} we remarked that by the structure of the 1--skeleton of $K(P)$ that $\pi_1(K(P),p_0)$ is generated by a set of loops in bijection with 
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathcal{L}(\Sigma) \coloneq \Set{\mathcal{L}(C) \given C \text{ is a 1--chain}} \,.
	\end{equation*}
Let $\chi \colon \mathcal{L}(\Sigma) \to \pi_1(K(P), p_0)$ denote this bijection. We now think of this presentation abstractly, and work to give a set of relations $R$ such that we obtain a group $\GroupPres{\mathcal{L}(\Sigma) \relations R\,} \cong \pi_1(K(P),p_0)$ where the isomorphism is an extension of $\chi$.

Again, by the structure of the 1--skeleton of $K(P)$ remarked in the proof of \cref{lem:fund_group_poset_complex_gen_labels}, there is such a set of relations $R$ in bijection with the set of 2--simplices in $K(P)$. Let $e^2$ be a 2--simplex with edges $e^1_i$ for $i \in \Set{1,2,3}$. We have that the edges $e^1_i$ are oriented acyclically as in \cref{fig:example_simplex_in_KP}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
		\node[FSC] (base) {};
		\node[FSC] (mid) at ($(base) + (0,1)$) {};

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{The orientation of all simplices in $\Delta(P)$ and $K(P)$.}
	\label{fig:example_simplex_in_KP}
\end{figure}

All simplices are oriented this way because if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq z$ then $x \leq z$.
Define loops $\lambda_i \in \Lambda$ such that each $\lambda_i$ follows the oriented edge $e_i$. Choose extended labels $\ell_i$ such that $\chi(\ell_i) = \lambda_i$. We see that the 2--simplex $e^2$ corresponds to the relation $\ell_1\ell_2\ell_3^{-1} = 0$. Here multiplication of extended labels is formal, as are inverses, denoted $\ell^{-1}$. Define $R$ to be the following set of relations for $\GroupPres{\mathcal{L}(\Sigma)}$.

\begin{equation}
	R \coloneq \Set*{\ell_1\ell_2\ell_3^{-1} = 0 \given \exists \text{ 2--chain } x< y < z \text{ where} \quad
	\begin{aligned}
		&\mathcal{L}(x < y) = \ell_1 \\
		&\mathcal{L}(y < z) = \ell_2 \\
		&\mathcal{L}(x < z) = \ell_3
	\end{aligned}}
	\label{eqn:relations_in_extended_labels}
\end{equation}
Following from the definition of $K(P)$, these are exactly the relations we need to extend $\chi$ to an isomorphism witnessing $\GroupPres{ \mathcal{L}(\Sigma) \relations R } \cong \pi_1(K(P),p_0)$.

Using the axiom of choice, we can choose an element of $\ell$ for all $\ell \in \mathcal{L}(\Sigma)$. We encode this choice in the function $f\colon \mathcal{L}(\Sigma) \to A^*$ such that $f(\ell) \in \ell$ for all $\ell \in \mathcal{L}(\Sigma)$. We now work to show that $f$ extends to a homomorphism $g\colon \GroupPres{ \mathcal{L}(\Sigma) \relations R } \to G(P)$.

To show this supposed extension $g$ is well--defined and a homomorphism, we need to show that it respects the relations in $R$. Let $\ell_1\ell_2\ell_3^{-1} = 0$ be as in \eqref{eqn:relations_in_extended_labels}. Recall the definition of $\mathcal{L}$ and the underlying geometry of relations in $R$. There exists a saturated chain $C_1 = (x_1 \lessdot \cdots \lessdot x_m)$ such that $\mathcal{L}(C_1) = \Set{g(\ell_1)}$. There also exists a chain $C_2 = (x_m \lessdot \cdots \lessdot x_{m+n})$ such that $\mathcal{L}(C_2) = \Set{g(\ell_2)}$. Finally, there is a chain $C_3 = (y_1 \lessdot \cdots \lessdot y_k)$ such that $\mathcal{L}(C_3) = \Set{g(\ell_3)}$ and furthermore $y_1 = x_1$ and $y_k = x_{m+n}$. The chains $(x_1 \lessdot \cdots \lessdot x_m \lessdot \cdots \lessdot x_{m+n})$ and $(y_1 \lessdot \cdots \lessdot y_k)$ both start and end at the same place. They correspond to the $G(P)$ relation $g(\ell_1)g(\ell_2) = g(\ell_3)$. Thus, the extension $g$ is well--defined and a homomorphism.

Recall $\phi$ from \cref{lem:exists_surj_hom_onto_fund_group}.
We have that $g(\Set{a}) = a$, thus $g \circ \chi^{-1 }\circ \phi \colon G(P) \to G(P)$ is the identity on the generating set $A \subseteq G(P)$. Thus, $g \circ \chi^{-1 }\circ \phi$ is the identity and $\phi$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

Note that our proof of the above was ambivalent to the identification of $n$--simplices for $n\geq2$. Indeed, these identifications do not affect the fundamental group, but they do ensure that higher homotopy groups are trivial. We can see if we did not identify the 2--simplices in \cref{fig:example_edge_labelled_poset_with_KP}, $\pi_2(K(P))$ would be non-trivial.
