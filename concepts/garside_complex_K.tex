Given an edge labelled poset \poset P, we can construct a group generated by the labels of $P$ with relations equating words forming loops in the \hassediag{} of $P$. For example


% filled small circle
\tikzstyle{FSM}=[circle,draw=black!50,fill=black!20,thick, inner sep=0pt,minimum size=1.5mm]
\tikzstyle{a}=[red]
\tikzstyle{b}=[blue]

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}[on grid]
    \node[FSM] (base)             at (0,0)    [label=below:$\emptyset$]                     {};
    \node[FSM] (bottom left)            [above left = 1cm and 1cm of base,
                                            label=left:{$\{1\}$}]                             {};
    \node[FSM] (bottom right)           [right = 2cm of bottom left,
                                            label=right:{$\{2$\}}]                            {};
    \node[FSM] (top left)               [above = 1.5cm of bottom left,
                                            label=left:{$\{1,2\}$}]                           {};
    \node[FSM] (top right)              [above = 1.5cm of bottom right,
                                            label=right:{$\{2,3\}$}]                          {};
    \node[FSM] (top)                    [above right = 1cm and 1cm of top left,
                                            label=above:{$\{1,2,3\}$}]                             {};
    \end{scope}

    \draw[a] (base) to node[auto] {a} (bottom left);
    \draw[b] (base) to node[auto, swap] {b} (bottom right);
    \draw[b] (bottom left) to node[auto] {b} (top left);
    \draw[a] (bottom right) to node[auto, swap] {a} (top right);
    \draw[a] (top left) to node[auto] {a} (top);
    \draw[b] (top right) to node[auto, swap] {b} (top);

\end{center}

Where we have taken $\subseteq$ as $\leq$. We have that this group is
\begin{equation}
	G = \left\langle\,
	a,b \,|\, aba=bab
	\,\right\rangle .
\end{equation}

We can construct a cell complex $K$ from $P$ such that $\pi(1, K)$ is $G$. We do this by initially creating a simplicial complex $\Delta$, where each $n$ simplex is an $n$--chain of $P$.
