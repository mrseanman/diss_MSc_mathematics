The Coxeter group of type $A_n$ is the symmetry group on a regular $n$-simplex. Being totally symmetric, any of the $n+1$ vertices can be interchanged so $A_n = S_{n+1}$ the symmetric group on $n+1$ letters. 

Here we will overview the definition of the configuration space $Y_W$ for a given Coxeter group $W$, and show why this space is indeed a configuration space, in that it is the space of configurations of $n$ distinct points on $\R^2 \cong \C$. We will follow \cite{fox_braid_1962} and show that indeed $\pi_1$ of this space is $G_W$, which in this case is the braid group on $n$ strands $B_n$.

Given a Euclidean space $\E^n$ with basis $\{e_i\}$, we have an action $S_n \acts \E^n$ by permutation of components with respect to that basis.
